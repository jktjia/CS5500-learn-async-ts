Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

Both sumPromise1 and sumPromise2 are called and log to that console that they've return from the call.
Then the catch logs the error in sumPromise2, and finally the timeouts end and the items in the array
are added to the sum and then sumPromise1 prints its sum.
